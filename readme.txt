Brand Regard is a user-friendly, cost effective brand asset management solution that makes it easy to maximize the impact of your brand.

The plugin connects to your Brand Regard account so that the assets you publish can be managed directly from within Brand Regard.

== Installation ==

0. Create an account at Brand Regard, www.brandregard.com.
1. Install the Brand Regard Plugin on your WordPress website.
2. Activate the Brand Regard Plugin on your WordPress website.
3. Go to your admin page (/wp-admin/) and under Settings you should have a new menu called Brand Regard.
4. In Settings > Brand Regard you will have to configure your plugin before you start to use it.
5. First, enter your company name. It's the same as the subdomain of your Brand Regard account. http://[company_name].brandregard.com/
6. Enter your Brand Regard API key. It can be found after you have logged in to Brand Regard and in Settings. Just copy the API key and paste it. Don't leave any empty spaces.
7. When your API key and the company name has been correctly entered you can select up to two toolkits. Leave one empty if you don't want to use two. You can select what to show from all your toolkits on your Brand Regard account.
8. Configure the thumbnails, i.e. how big you want them to be. The default is Medium.
9. The last thing is then to configure which page or a post within your website or post you want to attach the plugin with. If both a post and a page has the same name it will appear on both places.
10. Now we have configured everything and the plugin is ready to use.
